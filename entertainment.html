		   	     <p id="para2">Desperate parents of an ailing child, and an unsuspecting doctor, are the three lives caught in the whirlwind of conflicting questions of truth, reality and belief. Barff raises many questions - Is truth what we all experience together, or do we all have our own different truths? Does truth lead to belief, or is it the belief which constructs the truth?</p>

	             <p id="para5">“I'm very excited to participate in The Hindu Theatre Fest for the second time. This time, we will play Barff, a Hindi thriller set in a wintry night of Kashmir. It's a very unusual play with visual grandeur.”</p>

		   	     <p id="para2"> Two years since we watched Kamal Haasan in a full-fledged role on-screen. Instead we catch him nearly every day on TV in a verbal slug fest with dithering politicians and on weekends hosting a show that has viewers hooked. The discomfort politicians are exhibiting reminds me of Jeetendra confessing that Kamal was sending shivers down the spines of Bombay stars after ‘Ek Dhuje Ke Liye’ was released. Is he just going to create political ripples or take the plunge? The undeniable fact about politics is that it’s easier to comment. When Rajni proclaimed that even God can’t save the state if Jayalalitha won again, he was only echoing the popular sentiment at that time. It was not the sole factor for the lady’s rout.When Rajni proclaimed that even God can’t save the state if Jayalalitha won again, he was only echoing the popular sentiment at that time.
